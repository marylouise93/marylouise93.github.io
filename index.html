        Hi! I'm MaryLouise. I'm xx years old and live in Queens, New York. I moved to New York for a job at the United Nations, did that for a year and then moved to my current job.

        I'm the oldest of three kids, one sister and one brother. My sister is 11 months younger than me, and my brother 5 years younger. My family is all spread out: My sister lives in Chicago, my dad and brother in Charleston, and my mom and I are here in New York. But homebase for us is St. Louis.
